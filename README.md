# CordialCocktailRecipesApp

## What is it?

Cordial is an app to get cocktail recipes and to manage your home bar inventory. The app will let you know which cocktail are available to you with the ingredients you have.

You can also create new cocktails and ingredients, add cocktails to your favorites and ingredients to your shopping list.

The app also lets you have multiple profiles for different list of owned ingredients, and you also can backup and import all your app data, so you can send it to another device for example.

**The app is FREE, OPEN SOURCE and OFFLINE, so no login required, no internet connection required, no payment required.**

## How is it made?

The app is based on the expo framework and react native, as a hobby project. I curated all cocktail recipes myself using public sources for reference. I then used AI to help me give a description to each cocktail which I corrected and verified for the most part (there might still be a few errors in there). I also generated AI images for every cocktail which were as accurate as possible.
